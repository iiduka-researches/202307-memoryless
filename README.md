# Modified memoryless spectral-scaling Broyden family on Riemannian manifolds
This repository provides a solver of [pymanopt](https://github.com/pymanopt/pymanopt),
which is an implementation of modified memoryless quasi-Newton methods based on the spectral-scaling Broyden family.

All numerical examples presented in the paper are used this implementation.

## Experiments
The experiments follow the examples of [pymanopt](https://github.com/pymanopt/pymanopt/tree/master/examples).
